How did the universe look just a millionth of second after the big-bang? Was it like hadronic-matter, like we see around us today? Or did a more disintegrated form of matter exist then, at that temperature and pressure? What existed then? So, what is understood is that at very high temperatures (of the order of 10^13 K, i.e., 160 MeV) and baryonic density, hadronic matter disintegrated into what is called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The conditions for this matter to exist are so extreme that untill recently it existed only in two places: 1) after the big-bang and 2) in the core of neutron-stars.

Today, in state-of-the-art accelerators like LHC and RHIC, nuclei are collided at unpercedented energies; about 5.0 TeV center-of-mass-energy per nucleon-pair at the CERN LHC and a couple of hundreds of GeV at the BNL RHIC.
