Hi!! I am Jwalit Panchal, a graduate in Physics from the Department of Atomic Energy CBS, Mumbai, India.

I love breaking down and analyzing the multiple facets of a question. Making mathematical models, using computers to verify them, etc. is something I always look for. Anything that involves serious mathematical considerations interests me. Some broad research areas I would love to pursue are High-Energy Physics, Quantum-technology (computation, communication), ML/AI, Self-Organised critical systems, Computational Electrodynamics (simulation-based), and Mathematical Physics. Please take a look at Academic Interests for more information.

I am a football fan. I play football both electronically and physically. I love reading fiction novels; Agatha Christie is my favorite author. Dan Brown and Frederick Forsyth are also some of my favorites. I also write poetry. For more information look up Personal Interests.
