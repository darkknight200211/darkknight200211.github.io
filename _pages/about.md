Hi!! I am Jwalit Panchal, a graduate in Physics.

I am an aspiting theoretical physicist. A language has the power to glue individuals; I believe universe's language is Mathematics, like a universal glue. Making mathematical models, using computers to verify them, etc. is something I love. Anything that involves serious mathematical considerations interests me. I am into research in Plasma-Physics, Hall-thursters, Laser-plasma interaction, ML/AI, Self-Organised critical systems, Computational Electrodynamics (simulation-based), and Mathematical Physics. Please take a look at <a href='http://127.0.0.1:4000/projects/'>Projects</a> and <a href='http://127.0.0.1:4000/experience/'>Experience</a> for more information.

I am a football fan, who loves to play the game physically and electonically. I love reading fiction novels; Agatha Christie is my favorite author. Dan Brown and Frederick Forsyth are also some of my favorites. I also write poetry.
